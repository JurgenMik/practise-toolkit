Redux is a <strong>state management</strong> library for JavaScript applications.
It is often used with React, but it can be used with any frontend or backend JavaScript framework.
The basic idea behind Redux is to <strong>centralize</strong> the application's state in a single store, and to use reducer functions to update the state based on actions.

GraphQL is a <strong>query</strong> language for your API that allows clients to request
<strong>specific</strong> data and to receive exactly what they need, rather than a fixed set of data. It provides a flexible way to request data from a server and is often used as an <strong>alternative</strong> to REST APIs.
GraphQL is often used with a client-side library like Apollo

TypeScript is a programming language that is a <strong>typed</strong> superset of JavaScript. It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript adds <strong>optional</strong> static typing to JavaScript, 
which can help <strong>improve</strong> the quality and maintainability of your code.
