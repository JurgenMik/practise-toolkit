Redux is a <strong>state management</strong> library for JavaScript applications.
It is often used with React, but it can be used with any frontend or backend JavaScript framework.
The basic idea behind Redux is to <strong>centralize</strong> the application's state in a single store, and to use reducer functions to update the state based on actions.

GraphQL is often used with a client-side library like Apollo
